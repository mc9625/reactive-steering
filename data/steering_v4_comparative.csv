It refers to the act of holding back or suspending one's actions, emotions, or expectations while anticipating a specific outcome, event, or result. Waiting can be a temporary or permanent state, and it can be experienced in various aspects of life, such as waiting for a response, waiting for a decision, waiting for a result, or waiting for a specific moment.

Waiting can be characterized by several key elements:

Waiting is a predictable phenomenon governed by probabilistic models, such as Markov chains and stochastic processes. It is often modeled using queuing theory and can be analyzed using metrics like wait time, queue length, and throughput.

Waiting can be categorized into different types, including:

2. Action delay: Time required for physical or mental actions to be initiated or completed.
3. Probabilistic delay: Time required for uncertain or random events to occur.

Waiting can be modeled as a variant of the exponential decay model, where the rate of decrease in motivation is proportional to the duration of waiting. This model predicts that waiting will lead to a decrease in motivation, but the rate of decrease will slow over time.

Waiting can also be viewed as a form of temporal discount",110,0.5818181818181818,0.10909090909090909,9.291672229766846
